# Website
Creating a website on myself with HTML and CSS (and a little Java Script)


Hey guys,
So in this repo I'm basically posting every single thing I do on my website, be it add a picture of just put some text. You're very welcome to look through it, and take some elements if you think they're interesting to implement in your's, I'm not quite sure if it's worth it though LMAO. This is the first time I'm using HTML, I might create some more websites, in which case I'll move this one into another repo, and at that moment, well I guess you'de better take a look at the newer ones, because I am planing on improving, which induces that they'l be better.

Anyways, you haven't come here to read this, what can I say but thanks for having come to my Github, and have fun!
